# Lighted Magnifier

### Handheld, 3D-Printed, Arduino-Powered

I wanted to get a desk-mounted, lighted magnifier for my work bench, but decided to make one instead.
I am starting with a handheld version, with hopes to add a mounting option to it for later integration.

My current design specs are as follows:

- 100mm lens
- 9 volt battery as power supply
- Arduino micro for control
- Rocker switch for power
- 2 button (momentary) control
    - first button for switching light direction
    - second button for changing brightness
- 3D-printed housing
    - preferably designed in FreeCAD, for sake of open source-ness
